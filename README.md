The goal is to create a client to consume an existing API, and provide a UI to showcase some info from that service.

The deliverable will be a simple Angular app, where the user is presented with a nice navigable list of pokemon from the PokemonAPI. The list should be limited to ten entries per page. Clicking on an entry will render another view that shows more details for that specific pokemon.
